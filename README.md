Project Scope Description

Project Background
Lego building systems enjoy a fan base spanning all ages. Lego minifigures are a highly collectible component found
as set elements or stand-alone collectibles. Over 4000 distinct minifigures have been produced between 1973 and 2010.
Each minifigure is associated with a Lego theme or event, contains multiple parts, and may come with specific accessories.
There are several online communities devoted to this hobby, yet no comprehensive application exists to allow collectors to
track their inventory and share with friends. We propose to create a mobile application which would allow collectors to track
their collection by whole figures and parts of figures. 

Data
The core of the application will be an android application with SQLite database containing entries for all known minifigures
from existing Lego themes and minifigure categories as of the project start date. The database will also contain a parts
catalog for the individual components of each figure as well as accessory brick elements.

Core data will follow the model established by Bricklink Limited for their site www.bricklink.com.

User data will consist of account information and a list of which minifigures and parts are owned by the client.

Functional requirements
Users will be able to browse minifigures by categories and subcategories. Navigation will be touch or click activated dropdown
menus. Display options will be list style or images. Part inventories can be displayed from individual minifigure display
views.

The application display and functionality will adapt to different screen sizes, with optimization set for tablet devices.
Users will be able to note which minifigures, and how many of each, they own. A “partial” option allows the minifigure to be
listed by individual brick elements when some elements are not in the users’ possession.

The application will allow connecting with friends through social media to facilitate sharing collection details and allow
trading to occur to build collections.

There is a tie-in to existing Lego Brick reselling sites to allow purchase of missing figures and parts. 

Transmission and storage of images is a potential limiting factor to application loading / response times and memory usage.
Small screen sizes will limit the applications user experience when dealing with categories containing large amounts of figures.
